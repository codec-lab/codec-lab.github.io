    My research examines the cognitive, motivational, and social processes that 
    underpin human problem solving. I am especially interested in questions surrounding 
    the structure and interpretation of intentional action, such as: 
    How do people organize their thoughts and actions when pursuing individual or shared goals?
    How do people interpret and influence the intentional behavior of others using theory of mind?
    How do complex social phenomena emerge from the interplay of individual intentions? 
    I am also interested in how approaches from computational cognitive science can 
    inform the development of intelligent machines that interact with people.

My research interests lie in human behavior in complex tasks, 
specifically where humans need to process large amounts of information in limited time,
to make decisions. I primarily rely on statistical and computational modeling to 
identify how individuals filter and integrate complex information and adapt to 
dynamic task contexts. I am particularly focused on skill acquisition and expert 
strategies for optimal behavior in complex paradigms. I completed my PhD in 
Cognitive Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute under my advisors Dr. 
Wayne Gray and Dr. Chris Sims, studying team coordination in complex tasks. 
As postdoctoral associate at the Computation and Decision-Making Lab, 
I will be conducting research on optimal strategies for teaching people how to drive.

<p>
    I'm a developmental cognitive scientist studying how children learn about social categories.
    How do children form beliefs about social groups?
    How do children think about social structures?
    I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in psychology advised by Marjorie Rhodes.
    I received my PhD in psychology from Stanford University, advised by Ellen Markman,
    and my BA in psychology with a minor in philosophy from the University of Chicago.

<p>
    In my PhD, I am excited to explore decision-theoretic and program synthesis 
    models of human cognition and behavior. For instance, how do we represent 
    the tasks we want to accomplish, and when do different representations 
    elicit different attitudes and behaviors? How do we decide what representations 
    to prioritize and communicate?
    In the past, I have worked as a lab manager in the 
    <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Cognitive Science</a> & 
    <a href="https://cognition.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Concepts and Cognition</a> 
    Labs at <a href="https://psych.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton</a>, 
    earned my B.A. in Cognitive Science from 
    <a href="https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/undergraduate" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>, 
    and worked as a computer science educator at the 
    <a href="https://lawrencehallofscience.org/" target="_blank">Lawrence Hall of Science</a>.

<p>
    Jeroen Olieslagers is a PhD candidate in the Center for Neural Science at NYU, 
    advised by Wei Ji Ma. He is broadly interested in how people solve problems. 
    Currently, he is investigating the mechanisms of planning in complex problem 
    solving using the games of Rush Hour and four-in-a-row. Before NYU, 
    Jeroen got his MEng and BA in Computer and Information Engineering from 
    the University of Cambridge.

    Hello! I'm Sevan Harootonian, but I go by Sev. I'm interested in studying 
    mentorship and understanding the cognitive mechanisms that contribute to 
    its success. One project I've been working on examines how people infer 
    others' knowledge to determine the best way to teach them. I use 
    Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian models to figure out what mental 
    strategies people apply in teaching situations. Teaching is just one aspect 
    of mentorship, and I'm also interested in other important factors,
    such as inspiration and motivation.

    In 2020 I graduated from Rutgers with a double major in Philosophy and Cognitive Science.
    I then worked as a data scientist in finance for two years before coming to
    Stevens as a master's student to return to my passion for cognitive science
    and to further develop my computational skills. My specific interest is
    in learning about how non-linguistic cognitive abilities
    affect the semantic content of concepts. I'm currently working with
    Professor Ho on Inverse Hierarchical Reinforcment Learning, motivated by
    the goal of learning about how humans create and use concepts.
